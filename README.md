<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

GRTDataHub is primarily the hub for GRT data, providing visual representation of data collected from The Graph blockchain. Giving all GRT communities access to the most up to date information whenever, wherever, across all devices. All of them can be exported via the Export Page. I ensured the graphs are dynamic, meaning the equations for the x and y axis allow them to auto change depending on the data collected on-chain. This offloads a lot of workload needed to constantly edit and update the charts, meaning most of the time and effort spent developing can be spent on continuously improving the rest of the app.
<br />
The Chatbots will help answer any questions that you may have about The Graph and Web3. It will provide you with a link to the relevant documentation along with text and video tutorials so that you can seek further information, if you wish. There is no such thing as a stupid question, it is here help and educate!

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.

Contributing can be either coding improvements or translating for the current chatbots when improvements are made and new chatbots in development.

All translators that contributed are acknowledged at the top of the respective chatbots.

If you visit the <a href="https://grtdatahub.com/ENGTranslatorHelp">Translator Help</a> page via the button at the bottom of any chatbot. At the bottom of the Translator Help Page you will find 2 buttons for downloading all of the chatbot contents, the page contents and any other content that will need to be traslated when building a new chatbot. The file is availble to view or download in both Microsoft Word and Text File format.

<!-- CODE -->

## Code

I am a Novice Coder who does this as a hobby. However, I strive to be better each day. If you would like to make improvements then I am here to learn and I will be greatful for constructive criticism.

Guidance on updating the chatbot code can be found here, please see at the bottom on how to contact me if needed.

1. When updating the chatbots please see the respective message parser file. (e.g. ENGMessageParser.js)
2. The code will run through and find a match to the input from the user. Therefore the order needs have some thought about it to prevent bad or wrong answers produced by the chatbots.
3. For example, handleWhatIsTheGraph will need to be below all questions that may include "The Graph", in the event that the user asks. What is the graph? The chatbot will work perfectly. However, if the user was to ask, "How do I stake with the graph?" The user would get the wrong reply if the above messageParser was before handleDelegateGuides.
4. This will then trigger a response within actionProvider to give an answer. The order does not matter within that file however keeping them in the same order as the messageParser file is appreciated for ease of continuous improvements.
5. If a new item is added then please also add a button in its respective place at the bottom of the actionProvider file.
