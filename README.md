<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

GRTDataHub is primarily the hub for GRT data, providing visual representation of data collected from The Graph blockchain. Giving all GRT communities access to the most up to date information whenever, wherever, across all devices. All of them can be exported via the Export Page. I ensured the graphs are dynamic, meaning the equations for the x and y axis allow them to auto change depending on the data collected on-chain. This offloads a lot of workload needed to constantly edit and update the charts, meaning most of the time and effort spent developing can be spent on continuously improving the  rest of the app. 
<br />
The Chatbots will help answer any questions that you may have about The Graph and Web3. It will provide you with a link to the relevant documentation along with text and video tutorials so that you can seek further information, if you wish. There is no such thing as a stupid question, it is here help and educate!
